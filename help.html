  <h1>Mentoring: A Guid for mentees</h1>
  <h1>How to Obtain the Mentoring You Need</h1>
  <div class="mentorhelp1">
    <p>
      <h2>A mentor is more than an adviser.</h2> <br>A mentor provides you with wisdom, technical knowledge,<br>
      assistance, support, empathy and respect<br> throughout, and often beyond, your graduate career.<br>
      Mentoring helps students understand how their<br> ambitions fit into graduate education, department<br>
      life and career choices.<br>
    </p>
    <p>An effective mentoring relationship develops <br>over time. The student benefits from the mentor’s<br>
      support, skills, wisdom and coaching. <br>Later, both people deepen their working relationship,<br>
      perhaps collaborating on projects in which the <br>student develops into a junior colleague.<br>
      After a while, the mentee may need some separation<br> from the mentor to test his or her own ideas.<br>
      This distancing is a sign that the mentoring<br> relationship is maturing and providing the mentee<br>
      with the skills needed to function independently.<br> Finally, both mentee and mentor may redefine<br>
      their relationship as one of equals, characterized<br> over time by informal contact and mutual<br>
      assistance, thus becoming true professional colleagues.</p>
    <p>
      <h2>Benefits of mentoring</h2>
      <p>As an undergraduate, your objective was to obtain <br>knowledge; in graduate school your objective<br>
        is to contribute knowledge to a field of study and begin<br> to function as a member of a profession.<br>
        Even though you may be passionate about a particular <br>subject, your ultimate goal for pursuing an<br>
        advanced degree may still be evolving. This is <br>an opportunity for your mentors to assist you with<br>
        that evolution.</p>
      <p>Studies indicate that graduate students <br>who receive effective mentoring demonstrate greater<br>
        • productivity in research activity, conference<br> presentations, pre-doctoral publications,<br>
        instructional development and grant writing<br>
        • academic success in persisting in graduate school,<br> achieving shorter time to degree and<br>
        performing better in academic coursework<br>
        • professional success with greater chances of <br>securing a tenure-track position if seeking<br>
        employment in academe, or greater career<br> advancement potential if seeking leadership<br>
        positions in administration or sectors<br> outside the University.<br>
        Mentoring enables graduate students to<br>
        • acquire a body of knowledge and skills<br>
        • learn techniques for collaborating and networking<br>
        • gain perspective on how a discipline operates <br>academically, socially, and politically<br>
        • develop a sense of scholarly citizenship by <br>grasping their role in a larger educational
        enterprise<br>
        • deal more confidently with the challenges of intellectual work.<br></p>

    <h2>Mentoring enables faculty members to</h2>
    • engage the curiosities and energies of fresh minds<br>
    • keep abreast of new research questions, knowledge, <br>paradigms, and techniques<br>
    • cultivate collaborators for current or future projects<br>
    • identify and train graduate assistants whose work<br> is critical to the completion of a<br>
    research project or successful course offering<br>
    • prepare the next generation of intellectual leaders <br>in the disciplines and in society<br>
    • enjoy the personal and professional satisfaction <br>inherent in mentoring relationships.</p>
    <p>
      <h4>Strategies: Building your mentoring team</h4>
      Rather than trying to find a single mentor,<br> you may choose to build a mentoring team. <br>While
      mentors often are faculty members, they can <br>be your peers; advanced graduate students;<br>
      departmental staff; retired faculty; faculty <br>from other departments, colleges, or universities; <br>and
      professionals outside the University.<br> The team approach you take will likely be an informal one,<br>
      and the mentors you select may or may not <br>see themselves as part of a formal team. <br>If you have
      drawn individuals from varied fields or professional sectors,<br> your mentors might not know each<br>
      other, at least not initially. It is up to you<br> to decide if there are advantages to introducing your<br>
      mentors by proposing collaborative work.<br>
      Your mentor’s varied roles<br>
      Mentors play many roles in your life -- guide, <br>counselor, adviser, consultant, tutor, teacher<br> and
      guru. A mentor’s combination of professional expertise,<br> personal style and approach to<br>
      facilitating learning influences the<br> kind of mentoring you will receive.<br>
      Effective mentoring is multidimensional as <br>mentors play three core roles to assist your
      educational, professional and personal growth.<br>
      Disciplinary guide<br>
      Sometimes a faculty member will be a <br>thesis/dissertation adviser and a mentor;<br> in other cases,
      you benefit by having different people carry out each role.<br> Either way, the role of a disciplinary<br>
      guide is to help you become a contributing member of your discipline.
      This guidance helps you to understand how your discipline has evolved as a knowledge
      enterprise; recognize novel questions; identify innovative ways of engaging undergraduate
      students through your teaching and collaborative research projects; and see your discipline, its
      questions and methodologies in relation other fields. Another role of the disciplinary guide is to
      help you grasp the impact your discipline has on the world and to assist you in pursuing the
      impact you hope to have.

      Develop a vision of the mentoring you need
      To envision the kinds of mentors you should seek, reflect on others who served as mentors
      earlier in your life.

      <h2>What a good mentor does</h2>
      Engages students in conversation
      • Welcomes students to talk often, and invites them to discussions during office hours, in
      the lab, department lounges or hallways
      • Is in touch with students at least once a quarter
      • Invites students to coffee or outings away from the office for informal discussions
      Demystifies graduate school for students
      • Helps students interpret program guidelines and the Graduate School’s policies and
      procedures
      • Adjusts academic discussions to help students know what questions to ask or what certain
      terminology means
      • Clarifies unwritten or vague aspects of program expectations for coursework, exams,
      research and teaching
      • Helps students understand the finer points of forming a committee and how to approach a
      thesis or dissertation
      • Helps students understand the criteria used to judge the quality of their work at different
      stages of graduate study
      • Alerts students ahead of time to possible pitfalls, especially those that may affect their
      funding status.
      “It has been extremely helpful to me to have a mentor who recognized that academic procedures
      and protocol— everything from how to select classes to how to assemble a panel for a
      conference— are not familiar territory for a lot of people.”<br>
      “My mentor has been willing to answer the most basic questions without making me feel foolish
      for asking them.”
      Provides encouragement
      • Encourages students to come forward with their ideas at all stages of development
      • Motivates students to try new techniques .
      <h2>mentoring service</h2>
      <p>
        provides professional counseling and advice for <br>individuals and businesses for a fee. A mentoring service
        may provide career planning, skills training, project guidance, professional contacts, or problem-solving for an
        individual's career or
        within a company. A mentoring relationship may be for an unspecified or for a limited duration.

        A typical kind of mentoring in information technology is for the management of a software development project. A
        professional mentor may be hired for any or all of the phases of software development including the initial
        planning, architecture, design, development, implementation, debugging and testing, and deployment and
        installation

        Face-to-face mentoring is still the most common form of mentoring, but virtual mentoring is gaining popularity.
        Virtual mentoring uses videoconferencing, the Internet, and e-mail to mentor individuals or companies. This is
        beneficial for those who own a small business and are unable to leave their workplace and for those who live in
        rural or remote communities. Virtual mentoring is usually less expensive compared to face-to-face mentoring and
        provides an individual with more choices for mentors. Even if you choose
        virtual <br>mentoring, it is recommended to meet with your mentor face-to-face at least once.</p>
